**Neural network cancer prediction**

This is a project I did to learn about machine learning and neural networks using tensorflow and keras. 

I first completed this tutorial which uses the same model to predict enzymes from proteins using protein domains.

Then, I used what I learned from that tutorial to make a binary-classification model for predicting if sample gene expression is cancerous/non-cancerous.
The training data used is taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas and includes genome wide gene expression data from triple negative breast cancer tissue and matched normal tissue.
